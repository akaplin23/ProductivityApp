Procrastination is a widespread challenge, affecting over 80% of college students. It often results in late submissions, poor grades, and unnecessary stress.  While many productivity apps aims to address this issue, they are often abandoned when the initial motivation begins to fade. Most existing apps fail to provide a form of social accountability and engaging ways to set and track goals.
